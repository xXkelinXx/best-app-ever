# Proposal: [Lowest Price Searching App]
## [An app that is exacly what you need if you're looking to buy only the cheapest instance of the product.]
[Ian Wallace]

## Needs and Opportunities
I have found many times that when I want to buy something I just don't know if I'm getting a good deal on the product. With my app you can be
sure that you are getting the absolute powest price for a product. Other apps out there require you go into a physical store, but not mine. You 
can be in the comfort of your own home and purchase any product you need with a few taps of a screen.

## Audience / Clients / Users
Ny audience for this project will be consumers of products looking to save money. Many people are out there unsure if they are getting a good deal 
on a purchase. These will be the people that I am making the app for. In terms of finding people like that for testing, well I have many freinds and
family memebers that would love to use something like this app in order to get deals on products.

## Product
The actual product will be an app. I will most likley show it off on a phone or tablet.

## Timeline
What is your monthly timeline for this project. I want to see a list of
deliverables with deadlines. You may find that the timeline needs adjustment
during the course of the year, which may be fine. Check in with me if that's
the case. 

| Date          | Deliverable   |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| February 26   | Have the bare bones of the program laid out|
| April 1       | have a functional gui and semi-funtional app|
| April 29      | be almost completely done making the app look nice and have the app working at 90% of what the final product should be. (should be around the finshing touches stage)|

## Reality Check
In terms of funds for this project I don't anticipate needing to buy anything. The Android SDK is free to download and other than that there will not be
any physical objects needed other than that. A phone or tablet will be needed to show it off, but I already own one of each so that will not be a problem.

## Conclusion
I wanted to do this project not necissarily because this idea i new and i want to make something like this. It is mostly becasue the idea that I will be making
something that someone else is going to be able to use in their daily life is so cool. So by making this app I can finally apply the knowledge of programming
that I have to something that others will use is what is mainly inspiring me to make this app. Hopefully I can accomplish m
Wrap it up. Why are you fired up about this project? Inspire us to support you,
and give us a great reason to approve your project.
