This week I started work on making the basis of my app. Since I looked at tutorials last week I was able to quickly figure out what everything did in android studio. Also, I was able to continue with my research and figured out how to make a basic gui for my app. Hopefully next week I can add a little bit more functionality to the gui, but for now it just looks pretty.

This week was spent looking at tutorials for android studio. I learned all about the different tools and thing to help me make my app dream into an app reality. Overall I learned about most of the tools, but not everysigle one of them and though I may know about them, using the tools is going to be a little bit more tricky. I look forward to using my new knowledge to bring life to my app.
